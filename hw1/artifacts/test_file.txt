but you didnt have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i dont even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no you didnt have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i dont need that though


now youre just somebody that i used to know
now youre just somebody that i used to know
now youre just somebody that i used to know
